# Music Sync - Desktop #

## Information

The files in this directory are used for the phone to synchronize with the desktop media files.

The 'media' directory requires subdirectories (only 'default' is valid for now) for profiles.

The mobile application will also generate .m3u8 playlists for easier playlist additions.
