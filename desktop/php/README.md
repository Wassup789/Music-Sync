# Music Sync - Desktop - PHP #

##  DEPRECATED
This will *"work"* with **Music Sync v1.0.0.1 and lower** but because PHP does not support special characters, there is a chance of files not displaying. Another reason is the Windows application is a more flexible app compared to the PHP application (Customizable ports, playlists are easier to manage). Therefore, this portion of the project will no longer be updated. Use the Windows version instead.

## Information

The files in this directory are used for the phone to synchronize with the desktop media files.

The 'media' directory requires subdirectories for profiles. (A good method is to use symbolic links to add folders: [Link Shell Extension for Windows](//schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html))

The mobile application will also generate .m3u8 playlists for easier playlist additions.
